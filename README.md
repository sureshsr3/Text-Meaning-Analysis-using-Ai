# Text-Meaning-Analysis-using-Ai

## Problem Statement
Computers can compare and analyze text but often fail to identify and compare the meaning. This project aims to solve this by developing a solution that takes text and compares its intended meaning with provided data.

## Solution
We have developed an AI-based solution using machine learning concepts like cosine segmentation and binary mapping. The AI analyzes the meaning behind the text and compares it with the meaning of the test file, returning similarities and the percentile of similarities.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Framework**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup (BS4)

## Features
- Compare and analyze the meaning of text files.
- Scrape data from images and the web to compare the meanings of different research papers.
- Generate a difference report highlighting the similarities and differences between texts.
- Notify users about flagged similar files using a heat value or sensitivity of weights.

## Application
### Research Papers
- Scrape data from images and the web to compare the meanings of different research papers.
- Flag similar files and notify users.
- Generate `difference_report.html` to view differences in plain text and binary values of data repetition.

## Achievements
We have successfully compared text files based on their meanings, flagged similar files, and notified users about the similarities.
